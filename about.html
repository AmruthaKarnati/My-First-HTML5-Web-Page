            Hi there! I'm Karnati Leela Amrutha. You can call me Amrutha.
        </li>
        <li>
            I'm a second-year Computer Science Engineering student at VIT-AP currently majoring in Artificial
            Intelligence and Machine Learning, which basically means I'm teaching computers to think… while
            still trying to figure out how to think like one myself.
        </li>
        <li>
            My dream is to do something that make both
            my brain and heart happy.
        </li>
        <li>
            I'm passionate about building things that make life simpler, smarter, and
            maybe even a bit prettier... even if I'm still figuring out CSS.
        </li>
    </ul>
